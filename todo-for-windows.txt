set runtimepath^=C:\EdvardsProgram\HOME\.vim
let &packpath = &runtimepath
source C:\EdvardsProgram\VimRoot-wsl\VimRoot-wsl\vimrc

  > Set ANT_HOME, to directory above the bin directory
  > Add to path, %ANT_HOME%\bin
  > JAVA_HOME need to be defined, as an entry on the PATH, including %JAVA_HOME%\bin
* Run build command
  > From yappclipse, export a Ant build file
    - go to a project
    - File/Export ...
    - General/Ant buildfile
    - The original pom.xml files must be active, hide_jdtls should not be triggered
    - Paths to projects in same parent project has to be updated (refer to the project's bin dir)
    - Paths to jar files that resides in my personal repo has to be updated. (insert.manufacturing.util)
  > From command line (as far as I have reached for the moment), ...
  > ant init-eclipse-compiler
  > ant build-eclipse-compiler
* Create non-existent jar-files (for example insert.measuring.util)
  > Download and go to repository, open in yappclipse
  > Export ant build.xml file
  > Add target for building a jar-file

<target name="jar">
  <jar destfile="${HOME}/myrepo/insert.measuring.util_4.0.0.jar" basedir="bin">
  </jar>
</target>

  > Refer to insert.measuring.util_4.0.0.jar in build.xml for my project
